ABOUT
-----
This is a third-party port of the CoinSpark library v2.1 to Go.

The CoinSpark libraries help you integrate support for the CoinSpark protocol into
your wallet, or any other tool or service.

For more information and code examples: http://coinspark.org/developers/

HOW TO INCLUDE THE LIBRARY
--------------------------

* From the command-line:

go get github.com/bitcartel/go-coinspark/coinspark

HOW TO TEST
-----------

* Compile the Go test tool:

cd coinspark-test
go build
./coinspark-test

* Prepare some standard tests by following the instructions here: https://github.com/coinspark/libraries

* Navigate to the directory containing the test files:

cd CoinSpark-Tests-*

* For each '...-Input.txt' file, run the coinspark-test tool on that input:

coinspark-test Address-Input.txt > Address-Output-GO.txt
coinspark-test AssetRef-Input.txt > AssetRef-Output-GO.txt
coinspark-test Script-Input.txt > Script-Output-GO.txt
coinspark-test AssetHash-Input.txt > AssetHash-Output-GO.txt
coinspark-test Genesis-Input.txt > Genesis-Output-GO.txt
coinspark-test Transfer-Input.txt > Transfer-Output-GO.txt
coinspark-test MessageHash-Input.txt > MessageHash-Output-GO.txt

* Now check the corresponding GO and C output files for differences:

diff Address-Output-C.txt Address-Output-GO.txt
diff AssetRef-Output-C.txt AssetRef-Output-GO.txt
diff Script-Output-C.txt Script-Output-GO.txt
diff AssetHash-Output-C.txt AssetHash-Output-GO.txt
diff Genesis-Output-C.txt Genesis-Output-GO.txt
diff Transfer-Output-C.txt Transfer-Output-GO.txt
diff MessageHash-Output-C.txt MessageHash-Output-GO.txt

* If no differences were reported, the library has passed the C-GO consistency test.

* Feel free to look inside the input and output files to see what is going on.
